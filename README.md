# ORE_jsPsych
This is the repository of the ORE experiment for Dr. Maka Malania's Expra block course.

We modify the matlab-based Other Race Effect (ORE) experiment (originally coded by CCC) and turn it into a jsPsych version experiment, 
so anyone who has the codes can run the experiment can run the experiment on their own browser.


For information of jsPsych, go to https://www.jspsych.org/, or check out the paper:
